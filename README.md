# Random-Password-Generator
Generate a random password of 8 characters using Python script. The program will randomly generate a new password each time when it is executed.
The passwords generated will be 8 characters long and will have to include the following characters in any order:
- Two uppercase letters from A to Z.
- Two lowercase letters from a to z.
- Two digits from 0 to 9.
- Two punctuation signs such as !, ?, â€œ, # etc.

To generate random characters, we will need to use the ASCII code.
